###From Scratch SocialGather Web Service App.

###PROBLEMS FACED WHEN DEVELOPING THE APP.
1. 4/7/25: Am getting an error when using postman to make a post, error (Error: post validation failed:), my post schema is handled well, the problem is either in my api route when am trying to acess props from the request body, or am entering in, incorrect obj props when on postman.
  Soln:
 - I was entering wrong props compared to what was exppected from the backend data modals. I adjusted on the props i was testing with the API.
